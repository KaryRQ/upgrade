<h1>Platform Improvement</h1>
<h2>Target</h2>
<span>This project seeks to improve the experience in the use of the platform with which the different profiles of the company have contact with both employees of the organization and customers, this will help to improve communication between areas and to offer a better service to our customers.</span>

<h2>Interviews and survey</h2>
<span>The first thing we sought was to get closer to the platform users so that they could explain their problems with the use of the platform as well as learn about their day-to-day activities.
By interviewing them and seeing firsthand how they used the tool, we were also able to identify some points that could be improved in terms of design and usability.
We also launched a survey for some employees who could not be present in the interviews and we got more information that they had not expressed in the meetings, so with the data collected, we moved to the next point of the process.</span>

<h2>Empathy map</h2>
<span>By getting to know our people better and knowing how we should support them to improve their experience, we were able to create an empathy map of each of them and understand how they felt.</span>

<h2>User needs</h2>
<span>By seeing what the users needed, we were also able to create the needs of each of the profiles that use the platform.</span>

<h2>Journey Map</h2>
<span>With the above information already captured, we were able to create a journey map for each of the profiles, showing how they interact with the platform and marking how they felt and how we could improve in each of these points.</span>

<h2>User flow</h2>
<span>Once the research is analyzed and approved up to the creation of the user journey, we proceed to create the user flows for the new platform, this would be done for each workflow and each profile that was analyzed, making deliveries to the corresponding areas and receiving feedback to improve their experience as end users.</span>

<h2>Brainstorming</h2>
<span>With the research advanced, we met with the UI team to have a brainstorming session to share the findings and start working on the wireframes.</span>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Wireframes</h2>
<span>Once the user flows of the workflows of our profiles have been approved, we continue with the creation of wireframes to see how the information should be displayed and improve the experience of our users.</span>
<br>
